We have pushed through an amendment to the Bank Law asserting state control over Reichsbank. As expected, our former bourgeois allies are furious, as are our bourgeois voters. Former Reichsbank President [? if not luther_reichsbank: Friedrich Dreyse ?][? if luther_reichsbank: Hans Luther ?] has strongly denounced our government, [? if capital_strike_progress < 10: but there is nothing they can do. ?][? if capital_strike_progress > 9: but they can't do anything, right? ?]

We have ordered Reichsbank to print further funds for the purposes of government spending. Naturally, this is highly alienating to the middle class, who have begun to bleed from our ranks. Nonetheless, we have more money to spend now, though inflation is starting to tick back up.

@tariffs
title: Change tariffs instead.

Tariffs, or taxes on international imports, are another way to finance our government.

Historically, <span style="color: #c00000;">socialists</span> have been in favor of free trade and a low-tariff regime. Workers in export-oriented industries benefit from free trade, and they also benefit from lower prices for imported necessities. Do the present economic circumstances change these calculations?

Current tariff level: [+ tariffs : taxation +]

- @lower_tariffs
- @fiscal_menu: Change domestic taxes instead of tariffs.
- @root: Do not change tariffs or taxes.

@raise_tariffs

choose-if: tariffs <= 5
on-arrival: tariffs += 1; inflation += 1 if inflation > 0; inflation += 0.5 if inflation <= 0; unemployed += 1.5; budget += 2; workers_spd -= 5; unemployed_spd -= 5; rural_spd += 4*(1-dissent); old_middle_spd += 3*(1-dissent); ddp_relation -= 4; dvp_relation -= 2; lvp_relation -= 3; west_relation -= 1; east_relation -= 1; reparations_negotiation -= 2; eu_progress -= 1 if eu_progress > 0; peoples_party_support += 1; ddp_cohesion -= 1; rural_ddp -= 2 if in_grand_coalition or in_weimar_coalition or (in_popular_front and liberal_parliament = 0); tariff_goal_spd_peoples += 1; economic_growth -= 0.4;

Increasing tariffs leads to higher prices for basic goods, increasing inflation and hurting consumption among the working class. Retaliatory tariffs reduce the competitiveness of German exports, raising unemployment among workers. They also lead to an atmosphere of international suspicion, reducing our ability to negotiate with other countries.

On the other hand, agricultural producers and some small businesses benefit from higher tariffs, as farmers can now command higher prices for grain, and formerly uncompetitive businesses are now able to function.

Lowering tariffs helps workers and the urban poor by reducing prices for basic necessities. In addition, other countries are pleased by lower tariffs, and are more willing to negotiate on many issues.

Farmers are hurt by this policy, as cheap imported grain leads to ruin for some small producers. In general, cheap imports are detrimental for small-scale industries aimed at the domestic market. Those negatively affected have rallied behind the [? if not kvp_formed: <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>?][? if kvp_formed: <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>?][? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical":, stoking their urgency to reenter government to act upon this?].
